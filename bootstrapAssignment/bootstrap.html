        <p><b>1.What are the advantages of Bootstrap?</b></p>
        <p><b>ANS-</b></p>
        <p>1.Responsive:-In this era of technology, accessing the Internet has become very easy. These days most users use devices like mobile or tablets to access the Internet, for this, it is necessary that whenever you develop a website, the website is easily accessible. Bootstrap is used as a responsive framework to make it open on all types of devices.</p>
        <p>2.Automatically resizes:-When you create a website by using Bootstrap, the image and other elements are automatically adjusted, for this, you do not need to set the size manually, this saves the developer’s time. </p>
        <p>3.Easy to use for a web developer:-Bootstrap is very easy to use, if you want to create a website for business, then you can also develop a responsive website by yourself using this framework, here you get the option to set everything up easily.</p>
        <p>4.Includes major components:-Many types of options are required to be installed in any website related to professional business but on Bootstrap you get many types of major components easily inbuilt which include dropdowns, forms, navigation bars, progress bars, etc. to create a professional website. I am easy.</p>

        <p><b>2.What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work?</b></p>
        <p><b>ANS-</b></p>
        <p> Bootstrap, container is used to set the content's margins dealing with the responsive behaviors
            of your layout. It contains the row elements and the row elements are the container of columns
            (known as grid system).</p>
        <p>Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using default
            grid system. Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within
            them. Although containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.</p>
        <p><b>Bootstrap comes with three different containers:</b></p>
        <ul>

            <li>container, which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint</li>
            <li>container-fluid, which is width: 100% at all breakpoints</li>

            <li>container-{breakpoint}, which is width: 100% until the specified breakpoint</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p> It requires use with the default grid system.</p>
        <ul>

            <li> To establish width for the layout to give web content.</li>
            <li> To provide responsive fixed behavior of any web project.</li>
            <li> To sets the content margin dealing with the responsive behavior of your layout.</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <b>ANS-</b>
        <p>Bootstrap 4 uses a default font-size of 16px, and its line-height is 1.5. The default font-family is
            "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif. In addition, all
        <p> elements have margin-top: 0 and margin-bottom: 1rem (16px by default).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bootstrap 4 styles HTML headings (&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;) with a bolder font-weight and an
                increased font-size:</li>
            <li> <b>Display Headings:</b> &nbsp; Display headings are used to stand out more than normal
                headings (larger font-size and lighter font-weight), and there are four classes to choose from:
                .display-1, .display-2, .display-3, .display-4
            </li>
            <li><b> &lt;small&gt;</b> &nbsp;In Bootstrap 4 the HTML &lt;small&gt; element is used to create a
                lighter, secondary text in any heading:
            </li>
            <li><b> &lt;mark&gt;</b>&nbsp; Bootstrap 4 will style the HTML &lt;small&gt; element with a yellow
                background color and some padding:
            </li>
            <li><b> &lt;abbr&gt;</b>&nbsp; Bootstrap 4 will style the HTML &lt;abbr&gt; element with a dotted

        </P>
        <b>ANS-</b>
        <ul>
            <h3>Grid system</h3>
            <p>Bootstrap grid is a powerful system for building mobile-first layouts. It's very extensive tool
                with a great number of options.</p>
            <p>Bootstrap’s grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to arrange and align
                content. It’s built with flexbox and is fully responsive.</p>
            <li><b>Container</b> &nbsp;Bootstrap requires a containing element to wrap site contents and house
                our grid system. Without a container, the grid won't work properly.
            </li>
            <li><b>Row</b>&nbsp;Rows create horizontal groups of columns. Therefore, if you want to split your
                layout horizontally, use .row.
            </li>
            <li><b>Columns</b>&nbsp;Bootstrap's grid system allows up to 12 columns across the page.</li>

            <b>5.What is the difference between Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5 ?</b>
        </p>
        <b>ANS-</b>
        <div>It is an open-source framework from late 2011 that is used for designing responsive websites with a
            mobile-first approach faster and easier. Bootstrap is available for HTML, CSS, and JS. According to
            server-side languages like PHP, Node, etc. bootstrap helps to design the frontend. Bootstrap has
            made the work for developers easier by making the templates ready which are basic part of every
            website. Thus people tend to develop further and don’t waste time on basic templates with beautiful
            designs along with responsiveness available. </div>
        <br>
        <div>Bootstrap 5 alpha launched in mid-June of 2020. As it is in the alpha-1 version, in the future some

        <b>ANS-</b>
        <div>
            “Button Groups” in Bootstrap is a class of name “btn-group” which is used to create series of
            buttons in groups (without spaces) vertically or horizontally. This is the basic syntax of the
            button group class where each button has its own class of “btn”
        </div>
        &lt;div class="btn-group"&gt;
        &lt;button type="button" class="btn">Click&gt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        <p>Buttons have a default border-radius on the first and last buttons of the group.</p>
        <p><b>Adding Styles on Buttons:</b> Bootstrap allows you to add styles to your buttons using the
            following classes:
        <ul>
            <li>.btn-default</li>
            <li>.btn-primary</li>

        <b>ANS-</b>
        <div><b>Bootstrap:</b> helps web developers to create thumbnails that are used to show linked images in
            grids with the pre-defined classes which help to reduce codes length. Thumbnails are created to
            provide a quick preview of images with small images.
        </div>
        <p><b>Thumbnail Image:</b> A thumbnail is a small image that represents a larger image. Bootstrap has an
            easy way to do this with thumbnails. Bootstrap’s .thumbnail class is used to show linked images in
            grids (grid system), a thumbnail is created using class .thumbnail within the element &lt;a&gt;. The
            class .col-sm-* and .col-md-* (where * represent number ), it is used to create grids of the images.

        </p>
        <strong>Answere:</strong>
        <div><b>Bootstrap 4 Flex</b> The biggest difference between Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4 is that
            Bootstrap 4 now uses flexbox, instead of floats, to handle the layout.</div><br>
        <div>The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure
            without using float or positioning</div>
        <p>It’s important to understand that Bootstrap 4’s grid system is built with Flexbox. What sets
            Bootstrap apart from using Flexbox alone is the process of writing code. With Bootstrap, you can
            create a grid using only HTML. With Flexbox, you must use HTML and CSS. Let’s take a closer look at
            each process below.</p>
        <p>Bootstrap has a twelve-column system, which means there can be up to twelve grid columns on a single
            horizontal block. You can have more than twelve, they’ll just start to wrap rather than show up on a
            single axis, regardless of the viewport.</p>

                    <b>Success!</b> Indicates a successful or positive action.
                </div>

                    <b>Info!</b> Indicates a neutral informative change or action.
                </div>
                <div class="alert alert-warning">
                    <b>Warning!</b> Indicates a warning that might need attention.
                </div>
                <div class="alert alert-danger">
                    <b>Danger!</b> Indicates a dangerous or potentially negative action.
                </div>

                    <b>Danger!</b> This alert box could indicate a dangerous or potentially negative

        <div>A card is a flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for headers and footers,
            a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options. If you’re
            familiar with Bootstrap 3, cards replace our old panels, wells, and thumbnails. Similar
            functionality to those components is available as modifier classes for cards.</div>
